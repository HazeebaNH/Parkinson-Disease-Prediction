# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction
This is a project to predict Parkinson's Disease in a person.
Voice and image datasets were analyzed and Parkinson's disease predictions were done using both. Also developed a Chatbot for guidance on Parkinson's disease related queries.
Created CNN models for Parkinson's disease classification using spiral and wave image datasets, enabling accurate diagnosis of new images through combined predictions. 
Developed a predictive model using XGBoost based on voice dataset to identify Parkinson's disease patients.
